### Example: Testing for Primality

This section describes two methods for checking the primality of an integer $$n$$, one with order of growth $$\Theta(\sqrt n$$), and a "probabilistic" algorithm with order of growth $$\Theta(\log n)$$. The exercises at the end of this section suggest programming projects based on these algorithms.
